=================

Fractals and other graphical representations of mathematical structures
have interested me as long as I remember.
They are beautiful and tell strange things about the universe.

I made these Java applications originally in 2005
while I was still studying Computer Science in Helsinki University.
I probably made some Java versions even before that.
Before that I implemented them with C on MacOS in the nineties.
Maybe with Pascal on MacOS before that.
Writing these kind of applications have been a great way
to learn new language or platform or library.
I will probably continue writing these again
in new languages in the future.

These versions I found from corner of my hard drive
during some hardware update.
I decided to clean and update them and push to GitHub,
which is a much better storing strategy for this kind of stuff.
